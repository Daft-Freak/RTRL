#RTRL - A game like a roguelike except it uses a tick system (real-time) and not a turn based one.  
  
##Concept:  
* Tick based, allows more freedom with some effects like slowing as well as allowing a more logical food decay (7 minutes) instead of a step-based one.  
* Wiring, so you can sabotage my traps if you have the tools without it seeming like some generic system for disarming.  
* Being a douche, I will be taking all steps I can to make this as hard as I can without ruining it. You will starve to death, you can use fire potions on wooden doors (any door) or kick it down and mayeb get splinters which kill you.  
* Slight realism, you can't stab a slime because it's gelatinous. You also can't burn skeletons because they're made of bones, but acid helps with them.  
  
##Controls (all numpad):  
* In-game:
    * 0: Open inventory  
    * 1: Use current item on self if applicable (potions mainly, i.e. invisibility potion, todo)  
    * 4/5/6/8: left/down/right/up (movement)  
    * 7: Use tiles (open/close doors, unlock doors, collect all items from chest)  
    * 9: Use current item (sword, potion, whatever) in the direction you're facing (todo)  
* Inventory:  
    * 0: Close inventory  
    * 1: Select item to move/Swap with selected item (todo)  
    * 2: Dispose of item (todo)  
    * 3: Drop item on floor if space (todo)  
    * 4/5/6/8: Navigate inventory  
  
##Enemies:  
* Slime (todo):  
    * Difficulty: Hard  
    * What this does: A slime will grab onto you and slowly start eating you. You will take acidic damage and, after long enough, suffocation damage.  
    * What can beat this: Anything that causes fire, slimes explode when lit.  
* Skeleton (todo):  
    * Difficulty: Easy  
    * What this does: Skeletons slowly follow you around and beat you to death. You will take blunt damage for each punch.  
    * What can beat this: Any kind of weapon, most potions (fire doesn't work).  
* Will list more when ideas come through.
